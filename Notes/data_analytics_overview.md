# Data Analytics

With data and information as the most strategic asset of a business, the underlying challenge that organizations have today is understanding and using their data to positively effect change within the business. Businesses continue to struggle to use their data in a meaningful and productive way, which impacts their ability to act.

A retail business should be able to use their vast amounts of data and information in such a way that impacts the business, including:
* Tracking inventory
* Identifying purchase habits
* Detecting user trends and patterns
* Recommending purchases
* Determining price optimizations
* Identifying and stopping fraud

The key to unlocking this data is being able to tell a story with it. In today's highly competitive and fast-paced business world, crafting reports that tell that story is what helps business leaders take action on the data. Business decision makers depend on an accurate story to drive better business decisions. The faster a business can make precise decisions, the more competitive they will be and the better advantage they will have. Without the story, it is difficult to understand what the data is trying to tell you.

The underlying challenge that businesses face today is understanding and using their data in such a way that impacts their business and ultimately their bottom line. You need to be able to look at the data and facilitate trusted business decisions. Then, you need the ability to look at metrics and clearly understand the meaning behind those metrics.

## Overview of Data Analysis

Data analysis is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming and modelling data to obtain meaningful and useful information.

To analyze data, core components of analytics are divided into the following categories:
1. Descriptive
2. Diagnostic
3. Predictive
4. Prescriptive
5. Cognitive

### Descriptive analytics

It helps to answer questions about what has happened based on historical data. Descriptive analytics techniques summarize large semantic models to describe outcomes to key stakeholders by developing Key performance indicators (KPIs).
E.g.: reports of a organization's sales and financial data

### Diagnostic analytics

It helps to answer why events have happened. It supplements basic descriptive analytics using its findings to discover the cause of these events. Generally this process occurs in 3 steps:
1. Identify anomalies in the historic data (unexpected changes in a metric or market)
2. Collect data around these anomalies
3. Use statistical techniques to discover relashonships and trends that explain theseanomalies.

### Predictive analytics

It answers questions about what will happen in the future using historical data and modelling with statistical methods/machine learning techniques.

### Prescriptive analytics

It helps answer questions about which action should be taken to achieve a particular goal/target, helping make informed data-driven decisions in the face of uncertainty. Mainly utilizing machine learning techniques to find patterns in large semantic models. By analyzing past decisions and events, organizations can estimate the likelihood of different outcomes.

### Cognitive analytics

It attempts to raw inferences from existing data and patterns, draw conclusions from existing knowledge bases and add it back into the knowledge base - a self-learning feedback loop. Cognitive analytics help understand what would happen if circumstances change and determine how you might handle these events.

## Tasks of a Data Analyst

### 1. Prepare
Data preparation is the process of taking raw data and turning it into information that is trusted and understandable. It involves, among other things, ensuring the integrity of the data, correcting wrong or inaccurate data, identifying missing data, converting data from one structure to another or from one type to another, or even a task as simple as making data more readable.

Data preparation also involves understanding how you're going to get and connect to the data and the performance implications of the decisions. When connecting to data, you need to make decisions to ensure that models and reports meet, and perform to, acknowledged requirements and expectations.

Privacy and security assurances are also important. These assurances can include anonymizing data to avoid oversharing or preventing people from seeing personally identifiable information when it isn't needed. Alternatively, helping to ensure privacy and security can involve removing that data completely if it doesn't fit in with the story that you're trying to shape.
### 2. Model
When the data is in a proper state, it's ready to be modeled. Data modeling is the process of determining how your tables are related to each other. This process is done by defining and creating relationships between the tables. From that point, you can enhance the model by defining metrics and adding custom calculations to enrich your data.

Creating an effective and proper semantic model is a critical step in helping organizations understand and gain valuable insights into the data. An effective semantic model makes reports more accurate, allows the data to be explored faster and efficiently, decreases time for the report writing process, and simplifies future report maintenance.

From a Power BI perspective, if your report is performing slowly, or your refreshes are taking a long time, you will likely need to revisit the data preparation and modeling tasks to optimize your report.
### 3. Visualize
The reports that are created during the visualization task help businesses and decision makers understand what that data means so that accurate and vital decisions can be made. Reports drive the overall actions, decisions, and behaviors of an organization that is trusting and relying on the information that is discovered in the data.

The business might communicate that they need all data points on a given report to help them make decisions. As a data analyst, you should take the time to fully understand the problem that the business is trying to solve. Determine whether all their data points are necessary because too much data can make detecting key points difficult. Having a small and concise data story can help find insights quickly.
### 4. Analyze
The analyze task is the important step of understanding and interpreting the information that is displayed on the report. In your role as a data analyst, you should understand the analytical capabilities of Power BI and use those capabilities to find insights, identify patterns and trends, predict outcomes, and then communicate those insights in a way that everyone can understand.

Advanced analytics enables businesses and organizations to ultimately drive better decisions throughout the business and create actionable insights and meaningful results. With advanced analytics, organizations can drill into the data to predict future patterns and trends, identify activities and behaviors, and enable businesses to ask the appropriate questions about their data.

This feature is another area where AI integrations within Power BI can take your analysis to the next level. Integrations with Azure Machine Learning, cognitive services, and built-in AI visuals will help to enrich your data and analysis.
### 5. Manage

Power BI consists of many components, including reports, dashboards, workspaces, semantic models, and more. As a data analyst, you are responsible for the management of these Power BI assets, overseeing the sharing and distribution of items, such as reports and dashboards, and ensuring the security of Power BI assets.

Apps can be a valuable distribution method for your content and allow easier management for large audiences. This feature also allows you to have custom navigation experiences and link to other assets within your organization to complement your reports.

The management of your content helps to foster collaboration between teams and individuals. Sharing and discovery of your content is important for the right people to get the answers that they need. It is also important to help ensure that items are secure. You want to make sure that the right people have access and that you are not leaking data past the correct stakeholders.

Proper management can also help reduce data silos within your organization. Data duplication can make managing and introducing data latency difficult when resources are overused. Power BI helps reduce data silos with the use of shared semantic models, and it allows you to reuse data that you have prepared and modeled. For key business data, endorsing a semantic model as certified can help to ensure trust in that data.

The management of Power BI assets helps reduce the duplication of efforts and helps ensure security of the data.
